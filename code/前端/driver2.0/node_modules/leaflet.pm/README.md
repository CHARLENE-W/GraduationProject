### Installation

#### Install via npm

```
npm i leaflet.pm
```

#### Install Manually

Download
[`leaflet.pm.css`](https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@latest/dist/leaflet.pm.css) and
[`leaflet.pm.min.js`](https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@latest/dist/leaflet.pm.min.js)
and include them in your project.

#### Include via CDN

CSS

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@latest/dist/leaflet.pm.css" />
```

JS

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet.pm@latest/dist/leaflet.pm.min.js"></script>
```

#### Include as ES6 Module

```js
import 'leaflet.pm';
import 'leaflet.pm/dist/leaflet.pm.css';
```

### Getting Started

#### Init Leaflet.PM

Just include `leaflet.pm.min.js` right after Leaflet. It initializes itself. If
you want certain layers to be ignored by leaflet.pm, pass `pmIgnore: true` to
their options when creating them. Example:

```js
L.marker([51.50915, -0.096112], { pmIgnore: true }).addTo(map);
```

#### Leaflet.PM Toolbar

<img align="left" height="200" src="https://file-ffrjxxowri.now.sh/" alt="Leaflet.PM Toolbar">

You can add a toolbar to the map to use leaflet.pm features via a user interface.

```js
// add leaflet.pm controls with some options to the map
map.pm.addControls({
  position: 'topleft',
  drawCircle: false,
});
```

See the available options in the table below.

| Option        | Default     | Description                                                                                      |
| :------------ | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| position      | `'topleft'` | toolbar position, possible values are `'topleft'`, `'topright'`, `'bottomleft'`, `'bottomright'` |
| drawMarker    | `true`      | adds button to draw markers                                                                      |
| drawCircleMarker    | `true`      | adds button to draw circle markers                                                                      |
| drawPolyline  | `true`      | adds button to draw rectangle                                                                    |
| drawRectangle | `true`      | adds button to draw rectangle                                                                    |
| drawPolygon   | `true`      | adds button to draw polygon                                                                      |
| drawCircle    | `true`      | adds button to draw circle                                                                       |
| editMode      | `true`      | adds button to toggle edit mode for all layers                                                   |
| dragMode      | `true`      | adds button to toggle drag mode for all layers                                                   |
| cutPolygon    | `true`      | adds button to cut a hole in a polygon                                                           |
| removalMode   | `true`      | adds a button to remove layers                                                                   |

If you are wondering how e.g. the `drawPolygon` button will enable drawing mode
with specific options, here it is: Simply enable drawing mode programatically,
pass it your options and disable it again. The options will persist, even when
the mode is enabled/disabled via the toolbar.

Example:

```js
// make markers not snappable during marker draw
map.pm.enableDraw('Marker', { snappable: false });
map.pm.disableDraw('Marker');

// let polygons finish their shape on double click
map.pm.enableDraw('Polygon', { finishOn: 'dblclick' });
map.pm.disableDraw('Polygon');
```

All available options are specified in the Drawing Mode Section below.

### Drawing Mode

Use Drawing Mode on a map like this

```js
// enable polygon drawing mode
map.pm.enableDraw('Polygon', {
  snappable: true,
  snapDistance: 20,
});

// disable drawing mode
map.pm.disableDraw('Polygon');
```

Currently available shapes are `Marker`, `Circle`, `Line`, `Rectangle`, `Polygon` and `Cut`.
You can get an array of all available shapes with:

```js
map.pm.Draw.getShapes();
```

See the available options in the table below.

| Option                | Default                               | Description                                                                                                                                           |

You can listen to map events to hook into the drawing procedure like this:

```js
map.on('pm:drawstart', e => {
  console.log(e);
});
```

Here's a list of map events you can listen to:

| Event        | Params | Description                                                                            |
| :----------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pm:drawstart | `e`    | Called when drawing mode is enabled. Payload includes the shape type and working layer |
| pm:drawend   | `e`    | Called when drawing mode is disabled. Payload includes the shape type.                 |
| pm:create    | `e`    | Called when a shape is drawn/finished. Payload includes shape type and the drawn layer |

There are also several events for layers during draw. Register an event like this:

```js
// listen to vertexes being added to currently drawn layer (called workingLayer)
map.on('pm:drawstart', ({ workingLayer }) => {
  workingLayer.on('pm:vertexadded', e => {
    console.log(e);
  });
});
```

Here's a list of layer events you can listen to:

| Event           | Params | Description                                                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pm:vertexadded  | `e`    | Called when a new vertex is added. Payload includes the new vertex, it's marker, index, working layer and shape type |
| pm:snapdrag     | `e`    | Fired during a marker move/drag. Payload includes info about involved layers and snapping calculation.               |
| pm:snap         | `e`    | Fired when a vertex is snapped. Payload is the same as in `snapdrag`                                                 |
| pm:unsnap       | `e`    | Fired when a vertex is unsnapped. Payload is the same as in `snapdrag`                                               |
| pm:centerplaced | `e`    | Called when the center of a circle is placed/moved.                                                                  |

For making the snapping to other layers selective, you can add the "snapIgnore" option to your layers to disable the snapping to them during drawing.
```js
L.geoJSON(data,{
  snapIgnore : true
})
//This layer will be ignored by the snapping engine during drawing
```


### Edit Mode

Let's you edit vertices of layers. Use it like this:

```js
// enable edit mode
layer.pm.enable({
  allowSelfIntersection: false,
});
```

| globalRemovalEnabled()    | `Boolean` | Returns `true` if global removal mode is enabled. `false` when disabled. |

The following events are available on a map instance:

| Event       | Params | Description                                              |
| :---------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| pm:remove   | `e`    | Fired when a layer is removed via Removal Mode           |
| layerremove | `e`    | Standard Leaflet event. Fired when any layer is removed. |

You can also listen to specific removal mode events on the map instance like this:

```js
map.on('pm:globalremovalmodetoggled', e => {
  console.log(e);
});
```
The event has an object with an enabled boolean and a reference to the map.

### Cutting Mode

![cut polygon](https://file-xdeoyklwhw.now.sh/)

Enable drawing for the shape "Cut" to draw a polygon that gets subtracted from
all underlying polygons. This way you can create holes, cut polygons in half or
remove parts of it.

Important: the cutted layer will be replaced, not updated. Listen to the
`pm:cut` event to update your layer references in your code. The `pm:cut` event
will provide you with the original layer and returns the resulting
layer(s) that is/are added to the map as a Polygon or MultiPolygon.

```js
// enable cutting mode
map.pm.Draw.Cut.enable({
  allowSelfIntersection: false,
});
```

Available options are the [same as in drawing mode](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm/tree/new-docs#drawing-mode).

You can use these methods on `map.pm.Draw.Cut` to handle Cutting mode:

| Method            | Returns | Description          |
| :---------------- | :------ | :------------------- |
| enable(`options`) | -       | Enable Cutting Mode. |
| disable()         | -       | Disable Cutting Mode |
| toggle(`options`) | -       | Toggle Cutting Mode  |

The following events are available on a layer instance:

| Event  | Params | Description                    |
| :----- | :----- | :----------------------------- |
| pm:cut | `e`    | Fired when the layer being cut |

The following events are available on a map instance:

| Event  | Params | Description                       |
| :----- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| pm:cut | `e`    | Fired when any layer is being cut |

### Customize

##### Customize Language

Change the language of user-facing copy in leaflet.pm

```js
map.pm.setLang('de');
```

Currently available languages are `en`, `de`, `it`, `ru`, `ro`, `es`, `fr`, `pt_br`, `zh` and `nl`.
To add translations to the plugin, you can add [a translation file](src/assets/translations) via Pull Request.

You can also provide your own custom translations.

```js
const customTranslation = {
  tooltips: {
    placeMarker: 'Custom Marker Translation',
  },
};

map.pm.setLang('customName', customTranslation, 'en');
```

The 3rd parameter is the fallback language in case you only want to override a few Strings.
See the [english translation file](src/assets/translations/en.json) for all available strings.

##### Customize Style

In order to change the style of the lines during draw, pass these options to the
`enableDraw()` function.

```js
// optional options for line style during draw. These are the defaults
var options = {
  // the lines between coordinates/markers
  templineStyle: {
    color: 'red',
  },

  // the line from the last marker to the mouse cursor
  hintlineStyle: {
    color: 'red',
    dashArray: [5, 5],
  },
};

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly, Line, Circle, etc
map.pm.enableDraw('Polygon', options);
```

To customize the style of the drawn layer with leaflet options, you can either
pass the options to `enableDraw`:

```js
// optional options for line style during draw. These are the defaults
var options = {
  templineStyle: {},
  hintlineStyle: {},
  pathOptions: {
    // add leaflet options for polylines/polygons
    color: 'orange',
    fillColor: 'green',
  },
};

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly or Line
map.pm.enableDraw('Polygon', options);
```

or set the options generally:

```js
map.pm.setPathOptions({
  color: 'orange',
  fillColor: 'green',
  fillOpacity: 0.4,
});
```

### Feature Request

I'm adopting the Issue Management of lodash which means, feature requests get the "Feature Request" Label and then get closed.
You can upvote existing feature requests (or create new ones). Upvotes make me see how much a feature is requested and prioritize their implementation.
Please see the existing [Feature Requests here](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22feature+request%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) and upvote if you want them to be implemented.

### Credit

As I never built a leaflet plugin before, I looked heavily into the code of
leaflet.draw to find out how to do stuff. So don't be surprised to see some
familiar code.

I also took a hard look at the great
[L.GeometryUtil](https://github.com/makinacorpus/Leaflet.GeometryUtil) for some
of my helper functions.
